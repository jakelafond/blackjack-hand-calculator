# Black Jack Hand Calculator
Create an algorithm that will provide you the results of a Blackjack hand.

Blackjack is a game where players try to get their hand of cards as close to the number 21 as possible without going over 21. The premise is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21. If the dealer has a hand of 19 and you have a hand of 20, you win! If the dealer has a hand of 19 and you have a hand of 22, you lose! You always start with two cards in Blackjack, but each "round" you can choose to draw a card or hold. Your hand can grow over time.

## A Game of Blackjack  

The dealer gives me my first two cards, a 3 and King. The 3 is worth 3 points, and the King is worth 10 points. My "hand" is 13 points. During the next round, I can choose to "hold" my 13 and hope to beat the dealer's hand, or I can draw another card. I draw another card and get a 7. Now, now my hand has 3 cards and is worth 20 points (3 + 10 + 7). I choose to stop drawing cards because anything more than a 1 will put me over 21 and I will lose.

## Making the Calculator  

Taking this into consideration, were you to build a Blackjack game, you would need a function that can take any hand and return the total value of that hand. This function would be used a lot in your game. It should take an array of cards as an argument and return a single number. The number should be the value of the hand.

Let's say our function is called handValue. It would return these values, given these arrays:

```handValue( [ "2", "2", "8" ] ) === 12;
handValue( [ "2", "2", "K" ] ) === 14;
handValue( [ "2", "Q" ] ) === 12;
handValue( [ "7", "J" ] ) === 17;
handValue( [ "7", "A" ] ) === 18;
handValue( [ "8", "J", "A" ] ) === 19;
handValue( [ "8", "A", "J" ] ) === 19;
handValue( [ "8", "7", "A", "A" ] ) === 17;
handValue( [ "K", "A" ] ) === 21;
```
Start with the starter files below, and open index.html file in your browser. Open the JavaScript console. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

Your goal is to write a function called handValue that takes an array of cards and returns the total value. The interesting part of this is how Blackjack does the scoring. Here are the rules:

- Number cards are worth their stated value: 1-10 (1 = 1 point, 4 = 4 points, 9 = 9, etc)
- Face Cards are worth 10 points, Jack (J), Queen (Q) and King (K): J, Q, K = Worth 10 points each
- The Ace Card is special. It has two possible values, 1 or 11, whichever gets you closer to 21 without going over 21. A = Worth 1 or 11 points.
The possible values for cards are: [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A" ]
